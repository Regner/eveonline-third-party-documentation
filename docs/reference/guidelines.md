# Guidelines
These are general guidelines for using any of the services that CCP offers third-party developers.

1. If you want to do something and have to ask "I know this is bad but maybe they will let me do it anyways." Just don't do it.
2. Obey the posted rate limits, especially true for the XML API as that requires CCP to manually un-ban you, which will take more time.
3. Obey the cachedUntil values on the XML API.
4. Provide a good User-Agent header that includes your application name and some form of contact information.
